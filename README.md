# Cash Register Manager

It is an application made using Vanilla Js.
You have to input bill amount and cash amount, 
bill amount should be greater than zero and also 
less than or equal to cash amount.
In return/ output you will get minimum number of
notes in sequence like:
2000 - 500 - 100 - 50 - 20 - 10 - 5 - 1
